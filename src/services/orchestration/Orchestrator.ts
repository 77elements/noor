/**
 * Orchestrator - Abstract Base Class (Gossip Pattern)
 * All event orchestrators extend this class
 *
 * Pattern: Components → Orchestrators → Router → Transport → Relays
 *
 * Each orchestrator:
 * - Handles a specific event domain (Feed, Reactions, Thread, Profile, etc.)
 * - Registers filters with the Router
 * - Receives events via onmessage()
 * - Distributes to interested Components
 *
 * Based on: Gossip client architecture (code.png/code1.png)
