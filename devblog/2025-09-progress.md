**Key Achievements:** Architecture defined, layout system established, project identity finalized

---

## Major Decisions & Milestones

### 2025-09-20 (Project Planning Session)

**Critical Architecture Decisions:**
- **Hosting Strategy:** GitHub Pages + CloudFlare (following Jumble.social proven model)
- **Primary Relay:** wss://noornode.nostr1.com (moderated, legal separation)
- **Tech Stack:** Vanilla JavaScript + Vite + TypeScript (performance-first)
- **Risk Assessment:** Success probability 60% → 75% through strategic decisions

**Competitive Analysis Results:**
- Target <500KB bundle vs competitors' 600-1200KB
- Solo developer approach validated by Jumble.social success
- Performance advantages through vanilla JS architecture

**Development Environment Complete:**
- 5-step strict development process established
- SimplePool + DataLoader relay pattern implemented
- TypeScript + Sass + Vitest configuration ready

### 2025-09-21 (CSS Foundation Session)

**Layout System Established:**
- 3-column CSS Grid layout (150px sidebar + 50/50 split)
- Sass architecture with Atomic Design methodology
- 5-color brand palette finalized with strict usage rules

**Brand Color System:**
- color-1: #0f0d23 (backgrounds), color-2: #1a1930 (surfaces)
- color-5: #ede2da (text), color-4: #dc85ad (interactive only)
- Rule: NEVER use color variants without explicit user request

**Workflow Optimization:**
- Reduced workflow.md from 722 lines to focused standards
- Added enterprise-level development process from proven Clistr project
- Screenshot-driven development process established

### 2025-09-21 (Project Rename Session)

**Complete Identity Migration: "Noor" → "Noornote"**
- **Trigger:** Official approval from Noornode operator
- **Scope:** Package.json, documentation, source code, repository, working directory
- **Repository:** Migrated to https://github.com/77elements/noornote.git
- **Verification:** Build successful, all references updated consistently

---

## Current Status
**Foundation Complete:** Layout system, color palette, development workflow established
**Repository:** Connected to final noornote identity and location
**Next Phase:** Core feature implementation with established design system

### 2025-09-21 (Browser Authentication + Sass Migration)

**✅ Browser Extension Authentication:**
- AuthComponent with nos2x, Alby, Flamingo support
- Successfully tested with Alby extension ✅
- Architecture: Business logic in components, App.ts minimal

**✅ Sass Future-Proofing:**
- Migrated @import → @use (Dart Sass 3.0 ready)
- Cleaned color system to 5 base colors only
- Bundle: 8.39 kB JS (2.61 kB gzipped)

### 2025-09-21 (Timeline Implementation)

**✅ Timeline Core Implementation:**
- RelayConfig service with user's Jumble-based relay setup
- NostrClient with SimplePool pattern and rate limiting
- TimelineComponent with IntersectionObserver infinite scroll
- Follow-list fetching and timeline event loading ✅

**✅ Performance & Architecture:**
- Bundle: 19.76 kB JS (5.66 kB gzipped), 20.11 kB CSS (3.94 kB gzipped)
- Rate limiting: 100ms delays for respectful relay querying
- Event caching and deduplication
- Real-time updates during loading

### 2025-09-21 (NoteHeader Component + Layout Stability)

**✅ Standalone NoteHeader Component:**
- Reusable NoteHeader with profile photos, usernames, verification badges
- UserProfileService with DiceBear avatar fallbacks
- Timeline refactored to use component architecture ✅

**✅ Layout Stability Protection:**
- CSS Grid stability fixes (min-width: 0, overflow protection)
- Comprehensive word-break protection for long nevent strings
- Automatic detection and handling of strings >50 characters
- Bundle: 27.39 kB JS (7.54 kB gzipped), 24.95 kB CSS (4.69 kB gzipped)

## Next Session Goals (2025-09-22)
**Priority 1:** Content processing system (images, nevents, videos in notes)
**Priority 2:** Timeline performance optimization (faster loading like Jumble)
**Priority 3:** Independent scrolling areas (Primary/Secondary separate from Sidebar)
**Priority 4:** Fix infinite scroll bug (loads once then stops)
