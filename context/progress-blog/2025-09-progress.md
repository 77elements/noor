- **Risk Assessment:** Success probability 60% → 75% through strategic decisions

**Competitive Analysis Results:**
- Target <500KB bundle vs competitors' 600-1200KB
- Solo developer approach validated by Jumble.social success
- Performance advantages through vanilla JS architecture

**Development Environment Complete:**
- 5-step strict development process established
